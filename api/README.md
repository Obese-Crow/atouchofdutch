This is a template site for restaurants to "borrow" and implement "A Touch of Dutch" into their websites, that touch being the Dutch auction system. The Dutch auctions system is a system where the price amount starts at its highest and slowly decrements until a person places a bid, winning the auction. This template is meant for restaurants to auction off food items or seats for high-end cuisine.
